                - The affordability crisis is not uniform.
                - For renters, costs have grown slowly and predictably relative to income.
                - For buyers, costs have surged far faster than incomes can keep up with.

                **Bottom Line**:
                Renting remains more closely coupled to income, but the leap to homeownership has become increasingly unattainable.
